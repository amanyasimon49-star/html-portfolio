      Hi, I'm Amanya Odweleng. It is my pleasure to welcome you to my page! On
      this
      page, I will share everything you might be interested in knowing about me.
      I
      have also included links to my contacts, and you are free to reach out to
      me
      for any discussion.

      I am from South Sudan and a member of the Lopit tribe. I was born in a
      village
      called Habirongi in Imehejek Payam. I fled to Kenya during the Sudanese
      civil
      war to seek refuge in the Kakuma refugee camp on April 10, 2001.

      I am a teacher by profession. I started teaching in 2010, immediately
      after
      completing secondary school. Teaching was not the career I chose to
      pursue,
      but I had no option but to do it for survival.

      In the last few years, I realized I could venture into the world
      of technology after spending many years as a classroom teacher.
      So I decided to start learning coding and I can proudly say that
      it was quite rewarding as can be evident from the site I built
      since I started.
